Setting BsBuilder Up
=====================================

System Requierements
-------------------------------------------------

BsBuilder requieres:
   #. PHP 5.3 > (CLI)
   #. And that's it :)

Some tasks may requiere:
   #. A tar executable in the PATH
   #. A bzip executable in the PATH
   #. A 7zr executable in the PATH

Installing
-------------------------------------------------

Grab a copy from: :doc:`downloads` and put is somewhere you can reach it.
Make the ``bsbuild`` file executable (Linux only)

We are working to make this much easier and compatible with both Windows and Linux.

Don't get me wront, BsBuilder works just fine whereever but you may have to run it as: ``php bsbuild``.
